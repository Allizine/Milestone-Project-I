> A Card game using learned skills to show comprehension of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

<h2 align="center">How To Play</h2>
The deck is divided evenly, with each player recieving 26 cards, dealt all at once, face down.

Each player turns up a card at the same time, and the higher card takes both draws.
If the cards are the same, each player turns up one card face down or face down, higher card takes both.

<h2 align="center">How to score</h2>
The game ends when one player has won all the cards.

<h2 align="center">Implementing</h2>
Develop a script to actively randomize the player's draw.

Manipulate the DOM to display a card when it's time to flip one.

Script to compare the cards and determine the winner of each active draw and depelete the total amount of cards so it doesn't go on forever.</p>
